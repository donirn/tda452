-- Task 3.2 Size function description:
-- The signature of the function describes that from a hand we
-- obtain a number representing how many cards are stacked in the
-- Hand.
-- To calculate the function, the recursive nature of the hand definition is
-- considered.
-- An empty hand's size is 0. This is the base case for a hand.
-- size Empty            = 0
-- The only other possible case happens if the hand is not empty.
-- If that is the case, the structure of the hand consists of
-- a card and a hand that have been 'added'.
-- When this happens, we know that the size of that structure
-- is one (card) plus the size of the hand without that card.
-- This allows to pattern-match a type describing a card in order
-- to generate a sum of ones representing the size.

-- Calculating the size of a hand2 manually:
-- size hand2 =  size Add (Card (Numeric 2) Hearts)
--                     (Add (Card Jack Spades) Empty)
--              = 1 + size Add (Card Jack Spades) Empty
--              = 1 + 1 + size Empty
--              = 1 + 1 + 0
--              = 2

-- Function empty: Represents the base case for a hand.

-- This is done by taking in consideration the accumulated value each time
-- whenever the base case is not the one to compute.
